         Robots Exclusion Protocol User Agent Purpose Extension
                    draft-illyes-rep-purpose-latest

Abstract

   The Robots Exclusion Protocol defined in [RFC9309] specifies the
   user-agent rule for targeting automatic clients either by prefix
   matching their self-defined product token or by a global rule * that
   matches all clients.

   This document extends [RFC9309] by defining a new rule for targeting
   automatic clients based on the clients' purpose for accessing the
   service.

1.  Introduction

   (fill in)

2.  Specification

   We define user-agent-purpose as the new rule with a predefined set of
   values.  The values are registered with IANA at ... Below is an
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) description, as described in
   [RFC5234].

purpose = *WS "user-agent-purpose" *WS ":" *WS purpose-token NL
purpose-token = "EXAMPLE-PURPOSE-1" /"EXAMPLE-PURPOSE-2" / "EXAMPLE-PURPOSE-3" ; but check IANA for full list
NL = %x0D / %x0A / %x0D.0A
WS = %x20 / %x09

2.1.  user-agent-purpose

   The user-agent-purpose rule is semantically equivalent to the user-
   agent rule defined in Section 2.2.1. of [RFC9309].  As the user-agent
   rule, user-agent-purpose acts as a starter of rule groups.

2.2.  user-agent-purpose tokens

   The user-agent-purpose token MUST be a substring of the
   identification string that the automatic client sends to the service.
   For example, in the case of HTTP [RFC9110], the purpose token MUST be
   a substring in the User-Agent header, along with the product token.
   Here's an example of a User-Agent HTTP request header with the
   purpose token by the product token:

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; ExampleBot/0.1; ExamplePurpose; https://www.example.com/bot.html)

   The purpose token MUST be one of the tokens registered with IANA.
   Unrecognized tokens MAY be discarded by parsers.  Crawlers MUST use
   case-insensitive matching to find the group that matches the purpose
   token and obey the rules of the group.  If there's a group that
   matches the product token of the automatic client, the client SHOULD
   obey that group.  If no matching group exists, crawlers MUST obey the
   group with a user-agent line with the "*" value, if present.  If
   there is more than one group matching the user-agent-purpose, the
   matching groups' rules MUST be combined into one group and parsed
   according to Section X.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations are the same as in the parent [RFC9309].

5.  IANA Considerations

   The vocabulary used as purpose tokens are registered at IANA-URL.

6.  Examples

# robots.txt with purpose
# FooBot and all bots that are crawling for EXAMPLE-PURPOSE-1 are disallowed.
User-Agent: FooBot
User-Agent-Purpose: EXAMPLE-PURPOSE-1
Disallow: /
# EXAMPLE-PURPOSE-2 crawlers are allowed.
User-Agent-Purpose: EXAMPLE-PURPOSE-2
